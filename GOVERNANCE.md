# Governance

This skill follows the vibecode-prompt-builder family governance model.

## Update policy

Updates are surfaced to the user at the start of each session via the version-check
protocol (see `references/version-check.md`). The skill never updates itself silently.

## Improvement candidates

Improvements to the shared process belong in `references/vibecode-core.md`.
Platform-specific improvements belong in `references/platform-v0.md`.
Neither file may be updated by the skill autonomously.

## Scope

This skill generates prompt artifacts for the user to paste into v0 (Vercel).
It does not send requests, execute code, or install packages on behalf of the user.
